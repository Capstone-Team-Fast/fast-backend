\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Error used for commands that have been removed in setuptools.

Since ``setuptools`` is built on ``distutils``, simply removing a command
from ``setuptools`` will make the behavior fall back to ``distutils``; this
error is raised if a command exists in ``distutils`` but has been actively
removed in ``setuptools``.
